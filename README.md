RaffteSite

This project is the result of an experimental endeavor I undertook during my free time to address the question, "What would happen if I were to create something like this?" It aims to provide an answer to this question and is born out of curiosity and a desire to combat boredom.

The project is executed by uploading the list of participants and awards and applying settings as desired. The code is kept as simple as possible, and the page design is kept minimalist.
